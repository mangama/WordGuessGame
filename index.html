<!-- Computer guesses a letter out of the 27 and stores it somewhere-->
<!-- The user makes a guess and the guess is displayed-->
<!-- totalNumberOfGuess=10 -->
<!-- If userGuess=compChoice, we have a win, numOfWin++ and game resets-->
<!-- If userGuess#compChoice, guessesRemaining--;and when guessesRemaining=0 user looses and numOfLosses++ and Game reset -->
<!-- Game reset means guessRemaing =10 and computer selects a new letter, and the guesses so far goes back to an empty list -->

<!--      
Guess what letter I'm thinking of
Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)
Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)
Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)
Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.)
When the player wins, increase the Wins counter and start the game over again (without refreshing the page).   -->
